    "In the example, basically, the network is operated in two levels of blocks:\n",
    "- The feature levels: the number of genes $n_g$, the number of adts $n_a$, the number of peaks $n_p$. The related parameters are `dim_input_arr` and `uni_block_names` (meaning that they have the same length).\n",
    "- The subconnection level: the number of genes ($n_g$), the number of ADTs ($n_a$), the number of peaks in chrom 1 ($n_p^1$), the number of peaks in chrom 2 ($n_p^2$), etc. The related parameters include `dist_block`, `dim_block_embed`, `dim_block_enc`, `dim_block_dec`, and `block_names`.\n",

    "We explain the parameters as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dim_input_arr` represents the size of input features. In the example, it is simply $[n_g, n_a, n_p]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dim_block` represents the number of subconnected features in all modalities (assuming that the features have been rearranged accordingly). In the example, it is $[n_g, n_a, n_p^1, n_p^2, \\ldots]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `dist_block`: There are four distributions implemented: 'NB', 'ZINB', 'Bernoulli', 'Gaussian' for negative binomial, zero-inflated negative binomial, Bernoulli, and Gaussian, respectively. However, only 'NB' and 'Bernoulli' were tested and used to generate the results for the paper. 'Bernoulli' is used for ATAC-seq data, and 'NB' is used for genes and proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dim_block_embed` represents the embedding dimension of the binary mask. For example, `dim_block_embed = [1, 2, 3, ...]` means the mask will be embedded into a continuous vector of dimension 1 for block 1,  and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dim_block_enc` represents the structure of the first latent layer of the encoder. Using skip-connection helps reduce memory and computation complexity. \n",
    "In the example, `dim_block_enc = np.array([256, 128] + [16 for _ in chunk_atac])` means that the genes will be embedded into a vector of dimension 256, the adts will be embedded into a vector of dimension 128, and so on. \n",
    "For block `i`, we have a sub-network that takes both the features of size `dim_input_arr[i]` and the mask embedding of size `dim_block_embed[i]` and outputs a vector of size `dim_block_enc[i]`.\n",
    "After that, the embedding vectors in all blocks will be concatenated into a vector as the input to the encoder. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, `dim_block_dec` represents the structure of the last latent layer of the decoder. For block `i`, we have a sub-network that takes latent features of size `dim_block_dec[i]` and outputs a vector (the predicted features) of size `dim_input_arr[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dimensions` and `dim_latent` specify the network structure in the middle. For example, `dimensions = [256, 128]` and `dim_latent = 32` mean that we have a network $n_{in}-256-128-32-128-256-n_{out}$ where $n_{in}$ is the sum of `dim_block_enc`, and $n_{out}$ is the sum of `dim_block_dec`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameters\n",
    "Some of the important hyperparameters are:\n",
    "- `beta_unobs` represents that weight for unobserved features. `beta_unobs=0.5` by default.\n",
    "- `beta_reverse` represents the weight for the reverse prediction loss (use unobserved to predict observed). `beta_reverse=0` by default.\n",
    "- `beta_kl` represents the weight for the KL divergence loss. `beta_kl=2` by default.\n",
    "- `skip_conn` represents whether to use skip connections between the encoder and decoder, which is useful for imputation but may hurt latent representation learning. `skip_conn=False` by default.\n",
    "- `p_feat` represents the probability of masking for the individual features. The larger value of `p_feat` encourages imputation ability but also requires more training epochs to have a good performance. But the influence of it is not large when training for enough epochs, so we recommend fixing fix `p_feat` as any reasonable value, e.g. 0.2. `p_feat=0.2` by default.\n",
    "- `p_modal` represents the probability of masking out one modality. It is set as a uniform distribution by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mean_vals`, `min_vals`, and `max_vals`. By default, for Gaussian features, `mean_vals` is the observed means, `min_vals` is  $\\min\\{$ minimum of observed values of peptide i , 'mean - 3 * sigma' of observed values of peptide i$\\}$, and `max_vals` is defined analogously. For Poisson and Negative Binomial, `mean_vals` is not used, `min_vals` is zero and `max_vals` is the observed maximums of the corresponding block."

    "One can use reasonable values as in the example, except the following parameter requires some care depending on your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `beta_modal` represents the importance of each modality. You run the model on your dataset for a few epochs and pick `beta_modal` such that the likelihoods (which will be printed during training) of all modalities are roughly in the same order. Notably, the number of peaks is generally very large, so its likelihood will have a higher value. And that is why you can see it has a small weight 0.01, in the example where `beta_modal = [0.14,0.85,0.01]`.\n"
